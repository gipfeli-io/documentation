This service allows time tracking with detailed descriptions and in various projects. This will allow us to keep track of our invested time as well as how much time we spend developing and time in meetings.\\n\\n# Prototype content\\n\\nAs a first milestone, we see the tech review in early June. The goal there is to have a walking skeleton with most of the architectural decisions set in stone. As such, we\\nagreed on the following features that should be working in a prototypical fashion:\\n\\n* Staging Environment with auto deployment\\n* Login for existing users (without management functions and profile functions)\\n* List of existing tours\\n* CRUD functionality for tours\\n* Offline functionality (at least conceptually, does not have to work yet)\\n\\nThis set of features will allow us to showcase most of our application and architectural ideas, and it requires to have a working infrastructure ready. We also see the offline\\nfunctionality as one of the most critical aspects, so we want to focus on that as well.\\n\\n# Development process and timeplans\\n\\nAs per our thesis agreement, we will use an agile, Scrum-inspired approach. Therefore, we agreed on the following cornerstones:\\n\\n* Sprints are 2 weeks long, leading us to 11 sprints in total\\n* We use [a shared Github Project](https://github.com/orgs/gipfeli-io/projects/1) with both repository-specific tickets and overall tickets. They are organized in several\\n  buckets and will be used for our sprintplanning (\\"iterations\\" in Github projects). The following labels exist:\\n\\n  * `Backlog`: All tickets that come up during development or that have not been planned yet\\n  * `Sprint Backlog`: Tickets that are used for a given iteration (and have the iteration label attached)\\n  * `In Progress`: Tickets that are in development\\n  * `PR pending`: Tickets that are in technical review\\n  * `Testing`: Tickets that can be tested during the sprint review, i.e. they are already merged to staging\\n  * `Done`: Tickets that have been tested and can be deployed as a release artifact.\\n\\n# Various echnical discussions and decisions\\n\\n* We will be using [Material UI](https://mui.com/) for frontend components\\n* We will try to use [next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) and use [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) as an identity provider.\\n* We will try to use OpenAPI sepcifications and use the [corresponding nest.js plugin](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction) for auto-generated docs.\\n* As we have two repositories for frontend and backend, we should discuss how we handle shared types. Possibilities are custom npm packages or no sharing at all.\\n\\n\\nEntscheid Weekly:\\nImmer am Dienstag 20:00\\nBesprechen: \\nWas wurde erledigt.\\nAn was wird gearbeitet.\\nGibt es Probleme?\\nTimeboxed: 20 min\\nEntscheid Retro + Planning:\\nJeweils am Dienstag von Sprint Beginn, 17:30\\nBesprechen:\\nR\xfcckblick auf Sprint: Was haben wir erreicht?\\nPlanning n\xe4chster Sprint\\nTimeboxed: 1 Stunde\\n\\nNotiz Offline Funktionalit\xe4t:\\nUnvollst\xe4ndige Touren sollen gekennzeichnet werden\\nNotiz Benutzer:\\nZwei Rollen: Admin und User\\nhttps://auth0.com/blog/developing-a-secure-api-with-nestjs-adding-authorization/ \\n\\n\\nMeeting mit Tobi:\\nOpensource oder nur Docs opensource?\\nAuth Provider\\nAllgemein: Was erwartet er in Bezug auf Dokumentation?
