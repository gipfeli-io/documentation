Since we\'re using a very basic\\nsetup, we\'re (currently) not using any user or rights library, but we might start using one if we find one. On that\\nnote, we also discussed some approaches for handling JWT token and token refresh.\\n\\nWe also had some questions which we addressed:\\n\\n* [**Frontend bug**](https://github.com/gipfeli-io/gipfeli-frontend/issues/31): We analyzed the problem with Tobias and\\n  quickly found a solution. Besides, we also got some feedback regarding code quality.\\n* **Redux for state management**: We were wondering whether we should use Redux for state management. Tobias said that,\\n  given our current scope, it might be overkill, though our considerations were valid in that state would provide us\\n  with some cleaner code - however, it would require more investement and learning and might be overkill.\\n* **Using React context**: Since we do not want to overuse context, we showed our usage of context and Tobias said that\\n  we\'re using it correctly.\\n* **Should we drop next.js**: So far, next.js has proven to be rather cumbersome to use; and also the documentation is\\n  rather bad. Since we\'re not using any of the SSR capabilities (which we can\'t since we rely on custom data for each\\n  request), we were wondering whether we should drop it in favor of a pure React application. At this point, we\'re still\\n  able to drop it and the move should be feasible since next.js is basically a supercharged wrapper around React. Tobias\\n  said that it\'s okay to switch and that these are valid concerns - if we\'re not really using the framework (or not to\\n  the full extent), there is no reason for keeping it.\\n\\nAfter our meeting, we decided to go the oure React route - also because the offline functionality seems to be more\\nstraightforward to implement when not using next.js."},{"id":"sprint-3-review-sprint-4-planning.md","metadata":{"permalink":"/meeting-notes/sprint-3-review-sprint-4-planning.md","source":"@site/meeting-notes/2022-05-24-sprint-3-review-sprint-4-planning.md","title":"Sprint 3 Review & Sprint 4 Planning","description":"We added too many tickets and couldn\'t finish the whole sprint.","date":"2022-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 24, 2022","tags":[{"label":"sprint","permalink":"/meeting-notes/tags/sprint"},{"label":"planning","permalink":"/meeting-notes/tags/planning"},{"label":"review","permalink":"/meeting-notes/tags/review"}],"readingTime":0.65,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sabrina Wullschleger","title":"gipfeli.io Co-Creator","url":"https://github.com/Saela","imageURL":"https://github.com/saela.png","key":"sabrina"},{"name":"Lukas Merz","title":"gipfeli.io Co-Creator","url":"https://github.com/Tugark","imageURL":"https://github.com/tugark.png","key":"lukas"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"sprint-3-review-sprint-4-planning.md","title":"Sprint 3 Review & Sprint 4 Planning","authors":["sabrina","lukas"],"tags":["sprint","planning","review"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Development Meeting 4","permalink":"/meeting-notes/development-meeting-4"},"nextItem":{"title":"Development Meeting 3","permalink":"/meeting-notes/development-meeting-3"}},"content":"We added too many tickets and couldn\'t finish the whole sprint. \\nThe integration of the map took more time than expected and couldn\'t be finished in time.

The goal there is to have a walking skeleton with most of\\nthe architectural decisions set in stone. As such, we agreed on the following features that should be working in a\\nprototypical fashion:\\n\\n* Staging Environment with auto deployment\\n* Login for existing users (without management functions and profile functions)\\n* List of existing tours\\n* CRUD functionality for tours\\n* Offline functionality (at least conceptually, does not have to work yet)\\n\\nThis set of features will allow us to showcase most of our application and architectural ideas, and it requires to have\\na working infrastructure ready. We also see the offline functionality as one of the most critical aspects, so we want to\\nfocus on that as well.\\n\\n## Development process and timeplans\\n\\nAs per our thesis agreement, we will use an agile, Scrum-inspired approach. Therefore, we agreed on the following\\ncornerstones:\\n\\n* Sprints are 2 weeks long, leading us to 11 sprints in total.\\n* We do not use the product owner/scrum master roles explicitly, since this does not really make sense in a team of two.\\n  However, we will jointly manage our backlog both from a product owner and developer perspective, and we will help each\\n  other to facilitate our development.\\n* We will use a modified subset of the typical Scrum ceremonies. They are at fixed intervals so as to guarantee a degree\\n  of consistency.\\n    * `Weekly`: Serves as our daily - we will discuss what has been achieved, what is being worked on and where issues\\n      arose. This meeting is **timeboxed to 20 minutes** and is scheduled to happen **each Tuesday at 18:00**.\\n    * `Sprint ending`: At the end of each sprint, we will hold a **1-hour long** meeting covering the sprint review,\\n      retrospective and planning for the next sprint. This meeting will be held on Tuesday as well, bi-weekly, whenever\\n      a new sprint starts.\\n* We use [a shared Github Project](https://github.com/orgs/gipfeli-io/projects/1) with both repository-specific tickets\\n  and overall tickets. They are organized in several buckets and will be used for our sprintplanning (\\"iterations\\" in\\n  Github projects). The following labels exist:\\n\\n    * `Backlog`: All tickets that come up during development or that have not been planned yet\\n    * `Sprint Backlog`: Tickets that are used for a given iteration (and have the iteration label attached)\\n    * `In Progress`: Tickets that are in development\\n    * `PR pending`: Tickets that are in technical review\\n    * `Testing`: Tickets that can be tested during the sprint review, i.e. they are already merged to staging\\n    * `Done`: Tickets that have been tested and can be deployed as a release artifact.\\n\\n## Various technical discussions and decisions\\n\\n* We will be using [Material UI](https://mui.com/) for frontend components\\n* We will try to use [next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) and use [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) as an identity provider.\\n* We will try to use OpenAPI sepcifications and use\\n  the [corresponding nest.js plugin](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction) for auto-generated docs.\\n* As we have two repositories for frontend and backend, we should discuss how we handle shared types. Possibilities are\\n  custom npm packages or no sharing at all.\\n\\n## Further unsorted notes\\n\\n* Offline functionality: incomplete tours (i.e. offline tours without maps) shall be designated as such\\n* Users shall have two roles - administrators and users.\\n\\n## Questions for supervisor\\n\\n* Can we opensource our code?
