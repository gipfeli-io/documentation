This is the technical documentation for the gipfeli.io project. Our API documentation is realized with OpenAPI and
deployed as part of the backend deployments and accessible via [/api](http://api.gipfeli.io/api/). If you require a JSON
download (e.g. for import into Postman), you can use the [/api-json](http://api.gipfeli.io/api-json/) endpoint. Note
that you cannot directly use the OpenAPI interface to send requests in our staging or production setup. If you run the
backend locally, however, you can use the GUI to send actual requests to our API.

## Example image and GPX data

If you'd like to test the geo-referenced image and GPX upload, you are free to use both examples
in [this archive](/examples/examples.zip):

* `malbun`: Contains a GPX file exported from [SchweizMobil](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/) for
  the [FÃ¼rstin Gina Weg](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/de/wanderland/routen/route-0995.html) and images taken with an
  Android Smartphone with GPS enabled.
* `nz`: Contains a GPX file recorded with a Garmin Fenix watch and exported
  from [GarminConnect](http://connect.garmin.com/) from
  the [McIntosh Loop](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/whakaari-conservation-area/things-to-do/mt-mcintosh-loop-track/)
  in New Zealand and images taken with an Android Smartphone with GPS enabled. Some images have been geo-tagged later on
  using [FreeMapTools](https://www.freemaptools.com/view-and-edit-photo-gps-data.htm).
