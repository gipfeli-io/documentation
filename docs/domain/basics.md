gipfeli.io is a website that is rooted in the recreational domain of hiking. Its **users** are people that engage in
hiking and are looking for a means to **document** upcoming and/or completed hikes.

## Users

There is no specific demographic - users can range from young to old, all genders, levels of fitness and so on. As such,
it is important that the UI is simple yet appealing, since we cannot rely on the technical prowess of our users.

## Tour reports

The users create reports for the tours they are planning or have completed already. Tours can
range from simple strolls to multi-day adventures and be classified as such. In order to also know where these tours are
located, they can be geographically referenced on a map. In order to serve as some kind of diary, besides describing
them with several attributes, users may also add photos, which can be geo-referenced as well. Last but not least, they
might also add GPX tracks (either from a recording via app or watch, or via export from another site such
as [SchweizMobil](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/)).

Since multi-day adventures often include staying at huts or in a tent in remote areas without cellphone coverage, the
app also works offline by providing a means to complete the trip report for the past day, although with a reduced
feature set. Once the user gains coverage, they can fill in missing information and synchronize the data to the cloud.

## Administration

Naturally, as with all public-facing websites, some kind of administration is required to e.g. moderate and remove
entries. As such, there are users that may assume the role of administrator, allowing them to manage the registered
users.
