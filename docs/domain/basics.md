gipfeli.io is a website that is rooted in the recreational domain of hiking. Its **users** are people that engage in
hiking and are looking for a means to **document** upcoming and/or completed hikes.

## Users

There is no specific demographic - users can range from young to old, all genders, levels of fitness and so on. As such,
it is important that the UI is simple yet appealing, since we cannot rely on the technical prowess of our users.

## Tour reports

The users create reports for the tours they are planning (some sort of *todo list*) or have completed already. Tours can
range from simple strolls to multi-day adventures and be classified as such. In order to also know where these tours are
located, they can be geographically referenced on a map. In order to serve as some kind of diary, besides describing
them with several attributes, users may also add photos.

Since multi-day adventures often include staying at huts or in a tent in remote areas without cellphone coverage, the
app also works offline by providing a means to complete the trip report for the past day.

## Administration

Naturally, as with all public-facing websites, some kind of administration is required to e.g. moderate and remove
entries. As such, there are users that may assume the role of administrator, allowing them to access and manage all
reports by other users as well as to manage the registered users.
