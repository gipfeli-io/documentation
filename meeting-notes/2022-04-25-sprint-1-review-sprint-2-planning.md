These are the notes for the sprint 1 review and sprint 2 planning.

<!--truncate-->

## Review
- We currently do not have a DoD, but we don't need it for those tickets as it was prep work
- We could close all the tickets in the sprint. Setup of the project incl. deployment is done.

## Retro
- We both are happy with how the sprint went. 
- We planned enough work and could finish all the tasks in time.

## Planning

- Sprint Goals: 
  - Landing page finished
  - Login possible with predefined user (no registration etc.)
  - DB setup finished
  - DoD finished
