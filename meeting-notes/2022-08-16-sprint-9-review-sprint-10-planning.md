# Sprint Review
We were able to finish the gpx upload and start on some design stuff like the logo and color palettes. 

# Sprint Planning
We added two tickets from the nice to have pile and some maintenance stuff.

## Sprint Goals:
- Finish categories for tour
- Add some integration tests
- Add markdown to description

## Retro
We are almost feature complete and super happy about the current state of the application. ðŸš€ðŸš€
