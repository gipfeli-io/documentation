# Sprint Review

We added too many tickets and couldn't finish the whole sprint. 
The integration of the map took more time than expected and couldn't be finished in time. But we still could finish a lot of
open tickets and create a good foundation for the upcoming review.

# Sprint Planning

## Sprint Goals:
- Finish map integration incl. setting of start and end point
- Integrate api endpoints
- Offline functionality concept finished
- Offline functionality setup finished

## Retro
- We did some work that was not in the sprint (client side vs. server side props) which delayed the other tasks
- For the next sprints we want to reduce the amount of stories to work on
- But nonetheless: We are very happy with the things we could solve
