# Sprint Review
We were able to finish a lot of tickets in this sprint. We did a round of refactoring and adding
additional tests in the frontend.

# Sprint Planning
We will finish the frontend tests and concentrate on testing and finishing the documentation for the last sprint.

## Sprint Goals:
- Finish tests for frontend
- Test application
- Finish documentation

## Retro
We are very happy with the current look and feel of the application and are excited to start using it
on our next tours!
