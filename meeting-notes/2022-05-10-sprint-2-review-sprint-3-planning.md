# Sprint Review

We could finish almost all the stories except the ones that were trying
to use TypeOrm with Cloud Sql.
Currently, the frontend and backend can communicate with each other so we
can log in with a dummy user.

# Sprint Planning

## Sprint Goals:
- Finish setting up the database integration
- Add all the view components (mock the data)
- All Api endpoints mocked
- Have basics of architecture documented
- Offline functionality concept finished

## Retro
- We both are happy with how the sprint went even though we could not finish all the tasks.
