In this meeting, we defined our Definition of Done and fleshed out our milestone planning.

## Definition of Done

We decided to only specify the Definition of Done for our issues. The project-wide Definition of Done (i.e. in relation
to feature completeness) can be found in our Master Thesis contract.

For more details, see our [Definition of Done](/general/definition-of-done).

## Milestone Planning

We decided on four milestones that allow us for some flexibility while also guaranteeing that we meet the criteria for
the tech review.

For more details, see the [Milesontes and Planning section](/general/milestones-planning).
