We talked about the finished tickets and the work that is currently in progress. Tobias had some input about the documentation
of our current setup. At the moment we document the application components for the version running on the server only
(see [Infrastructure Basics](/docs/infrastructure/basics)). 
He advised us to do the documentation of the components for the local environment too (incl. the new docker setup). 
We created a ticket for this: https://github.com/gipfeli-io/documentation/issues/19

Questions:

How do we need to provide the hourly report?
- Tobias would prefer the hours summarized by sprint. 
- See ticket "Export working hours" on project board (unfortunately there is no direct link we can provide): https://github.com/orgs/gipfeli-io/projects/1/views/1#
