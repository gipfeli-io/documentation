# Sprint Review
We could add a simple image upload when creating/editing tours. This is the base for adding the geo referenced upload of tour images.
The offline functionality is also implemented in a basic form (without synchronizing to the backend). We think we are still on track with
the main features.

# Sprint Planning

## Sprint Goals:
- Add synchronization for offline tours
- Finish offline functionality
- Add support for geo referenced image upload

## Retro
We are happy with the sprint and think we made good progress with the must-have features.
