# Sprint Review
The offline functionality could be finished and the bugs we found during testing could be resolved. 🎉🎉 We could also
finish implementing the admin functionality and add validation to our forms. :) Resetting a password is also possible now.
This means we reached all the sprint goals from sprint 8! 🥐🥐

# Sprint Planning

## Sprint Goals:
- Finish GPX Import
- Finish creation of logo
- Finish creation of icons
- Create a themes draft

## Retro
The sprint was very productive, and we could finish a big portion of the workload. :)
