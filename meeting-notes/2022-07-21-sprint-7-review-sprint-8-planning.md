# Sprint Review
We could finish the gps extraction of the images, and the images are now shown on the map. As an extra feature we implemented a 
cluster feature that clusters the images, so they don't clutter the map. 🎉 After a discussion with Tobi we decided to re-write
the offline feature. It is on a good way but unfortunately not yet finished.

# Sprint Planning

## Sprint Goals:
- Finish the admin panel
- Finish offline functionality (this time for real🥐)
- Password reset
- Validations (Forms, overall)

## Retro
We are happy with the sprint and think we made good progress with the must-have features.
