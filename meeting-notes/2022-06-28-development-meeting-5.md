This bi-weekly meeting was to show Tobias, our supervisor, our current progress in the form of a demo.

In the demo we showed

* The current status of the offline functionality
* The user on-boarding process

We also talked about auto synchronizing offline data and the options we have. As well as our use of the service worker and IndexedDB.
