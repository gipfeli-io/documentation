This bi-weekly meeting was to show Tobias, our supervisor, our current progress.

We showed our current progress, including

* Documentation
* Frontend with backend integration
* Testing implementation

Tobias mentioned we should not waste too much time on CICD issues, which is why we decided to postpone database tests to
a later stage and focus on unit tests.
