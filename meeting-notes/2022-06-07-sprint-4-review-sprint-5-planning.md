# Sprint Review

It was a very productive sprint. We could finish a lot of stories and were even able to re-write the frontend so it 
only uses ReactJS instead of NextJS. ðŸŽ‰ The only big story still open is the setup for the offline functionality. But it is 
almost done.

# Sprint Planning

## Sprint Goals:
- Simple offline functionality finished (load list of tours even in offline mode)
- Finish user authentication: Auto logout, Refresh token, Sign up

## Vacation
- Sabrina: 11.6. - 19.6.

## Retro
- We are very happy with the past sprint. We could finish a lot of important stories and think we are on a good way. ðŸ‘Œ
