        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This bi-weekly meeting was to show Tobias, our supervisor, our current progress.</p><p>We showed our current progress, including</p><ul><li>Our last sprint</li><li>Our current sprint goals</li><li>Quick demo for our current progress</li></ul><p>Tobias asked about our approach to user management and whether we're using a library. Since we're using a very basic
setup, we're (currently) not using any user or rights library, but we might start using one if we find one. On that
note, we also discussed some approaches for handling JWT token and token refresh.</p><p>We also had some questions which we addressed:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/gipfeli-io/gipfeli-frontend/issues/31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Frontend bug</strong></a>: We analyzed the problem with Tobias and
quickly found a solution. Besides, we also got some feedback regarding code quality.</li><li><strong>Redux for state management</strong>: We were wondering whether we should use Redux for state management. Tobias said that,
given our current scope, it might be overkill, though our considerations were valid in that state would provide us
with some cleaner code - however, it would require more investement and learning and might be overkill.</li><li><strong>Using React context</strong>: Since we do not want to overuse context, we showed our usage of context and Tobias said that
we're using it correctly.</li><li><strong>Should we drop next.js</strong>: So far, next.js has proven to be rather cumbersome to use; and also the documentation is
rather bad. Since we're not using any of the SSR capabilities (which we can't since we rely on custom data for each
request), we were wondering whether we should drop it in favor of a pure React application. At this point, we're still
able to drop it and the move should be feasible since next.js is basically a supercharged wrapper around React. Tobias
said that it's okay to switch and that these are valid concerns - if we're not really using the framework (or not to
the full extent), there is no reason for keeping it.</li></ul><p>After our meeting, we decided to go the oure React route - also because the offline functionality seems to be more
straightforward to implement when not using next.js.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to kick things off, we decided to start with a very general kick off meeting.</p><p>This meeting was not yet part of any sprint, but rather designed as a setup-meeting for all things to come.</p><p>The following points were discussed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="time-tracking">Time tracking<a class="hash-link" href="#time-tracking" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>We decided to use the <a href="https://clockify.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clockify.me</a> service. This service allows time tracking with detailed
descriptions and in various projects. This will allow us to keep track of our invested time as well as how much time we
spend developing and time in meetings.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prototype-content">Prototype content<a class="hash-link" href="#prototype-content" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>As a first milestone, we see the tech review in early June. The goal there is to have a walking skeleton with most of
the architectural decisions set in stone. As such, we agreed on the following features that should be working in a
prototypical fashion:</p><ul><li>Staging Environment with auto deployment</li><li>Login for existing users (without management functions and profile functions)</li><li>List of existing tours</li><li>CRUD functionality for tours</li><li>Offline functionality (at least conceptually, does not have to work yet)</li></ul><p>This set of features will allow us to showcase most of our application and architectural ideas, and it requires to have
a working infrastructure ready. We also see the offline functionality as one of the most critical aspects, so we want to
focus on that as well.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development-process-and-timeplans">Development process and timeplans<a class="hash-link" href="#development-process-and-timeplans" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>As per our thesis agreement, we will use an agile, Scrum-inspired approach. Therefore, we agreed on the following
cornerstones:</p><ul><li><p>Sprints are 2 weeks long, leading us to 11 sprints in total.</p></li><li><p>We do not use the product owner/scrum master roles explicitly, since this does not really make sense in a team of two.
However, we will jointly manage our backlog both from a product owner and developer perspective, and we will help each
other to facilitate our development.</p></li><li><p>We will use a modified subset of the typical Scrum ceremonies. They are at fixed intervals so as to guarantee a degree
of consistency.</p><ul><li><code>Weekly</code>: Serves as our daily - we will discuss what has been achieved, what is being worked on and where issues
arose. This meeting is <strong>timeboxed to 20 minutes</strong> and is scheduled to happen <strong>each Tuesday at 18:00</strong>.</li><li><code>Sprint ending</code>: At the end of each sprint, we will hold a <strong>1-hour long</strong> meeting covering the sprint review,
retrospective and planning for the next sprint. This meeting will be held on Tuesday as well, bi-weekly, whenever
a new sprint starts.</li></ul></li><li><p>We use <a href="https://github.com/orgs/gipfeli-io/projects/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a shared Github Project</a> with both repository-specific tickets
and overall tickets. They are organized in several buckets and will be used for our sprintplanning ("iterations" in
Github projects). The following labels exist:</p><ul><li><code>Backlog</code>: All tickets that come up during development or that have not been planned yet</li><li><code>Sprint Backlog</code>: Tickets that are used for a given iteration (and have the iteration label attached)</li><li><code>In Progress</code>: Tickets that are in development</li><li><code>PR pending</code>: Tickets that are in technical review</li><li><code>Testing</code>: Tickets that can be tested during the sprint review, i.e. they are already merged to staging</li><li><code>Done</code>: Tickets that have been tested and can be deployed as a release artifact.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="various-technical-discussions-and-decisions">Various technical discussions and decisions<a class="hash-link" href="#various-technical-discussions-and-decisions" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><ul><li>We will be using <a href="https://mui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Material UI</a> for frontend components</li><li>We will try to use <a href="https://next-auth.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next-auth</a> and use <a href="https://auth0.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auth0</a> as an identity provider.</li><li>We will try to use OpenAPI sepcifications and use
the <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">corresponding nest.js plugin</a> for auto-generated docs.</li><li>As we have two repositories for frontend and backend, we should discuss how we handle shared types. Possibilities are
custom npm packages or no sharing at all.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="further-unsorted-notes">Further unsorted notes<a class="hash-link" href="#further-unsorted-notes" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><ul><li>Offline functionality: incomplete tours (i.e. offline tours without maps) shall be designated as such</li><li>Users shall have two roles - administrators and users.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="questions-for-supervisor">Questions for supervisor<a class="hash-link" href="#questions-for-supervisor" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><ul><li>Can we opensource our code? This would allow for more flexibility in the free plan on Github.com</li><li>Can we use Auth0?</li><li>What is required in terms of documentation, meetings, milestones, definition of done?</li><li>Best practices for sharing types across repositories?</li></ul>]]></content>
