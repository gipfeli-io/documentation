# Sprint Review

We could finish the signup process and get a good overview of the offline functionality.
The offline functionality is also already started and we can continue with this so it hopefully
will be finished at the end of Sprint 6.

# Sprint Planning

## Sprint Goals:
- Finish offline functionality for tours (without user login)
- Add simple image upload to tour (without coordinate information)
- Password reset

## Retro
- I'm (Sabrina) not entirely happy with the status of the offline functionality. I wanted to have the tour list offline functionality finished.
- However, we are very happy about the overall state.
