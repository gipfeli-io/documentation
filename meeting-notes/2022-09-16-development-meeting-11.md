Since we deem our application feature-complete, we tested the application together and checked with
our [functional and non-functional requirements](/docs/design/requirements)
and [use cases](/docs/design/use-cases) whether they are fulfilled or not.

We also fixed a bug with our offline functionality that we noticed during a joint real-life test.

Last but not least, we split our remaining documentation requirements so we can work on finishing the documentation.
