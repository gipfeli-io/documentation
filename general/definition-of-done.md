title: "Definition of done"

This document outlines the definition of done (DoD) for the duration of our master thesis. Each ticket inside
the `Testing` bucket may only move to the `Done` bucket once the DoD presented here is met.

:::info Note

Discretion is advised! Since not all criteria can be applied to all tasks, it may well be that an item is
considered `Done` even when not having fulfilled any or all of the criteria mentioned here.

For example, a ticket for setting up a deployment strategy does not have any unit tests and as such will not be judged
against this criterion.

:::

## Criteria

- [ ] Code is written
- [ ] Tests (if necessary) are written
- [ ] Code is documented (either in documentation itself or in code)
- [ ] Code is reviewed
- [ ] Must implement functionality specified in the ticket and in line with the design specifications (e.g. wireframes)
- [ ] Build is successful (including all tests passed)
- [ ] Deployment to staging works
- [ ] Manual testing on staging by peer
