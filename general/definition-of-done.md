This document outlines the definition of done (DoD) for the duration of our master thesis. Each ticket inside the `Testing` bucket may only move to the `Done` bucket once the DoD presented here is met.

:::tip Note

Discretion is advised! Since not all criteria can be applied to all tasks, it may well be that an item is considered `Done` even when not having fulfilled any or all of the criteria mentioned here.

For example, a ticket for setting up a deployment strategy does not have any unit tests and as such will not be judged against this criterion.
