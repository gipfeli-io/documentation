| 7   | 2022-04-19 | Do not use Auth0: After some research, we found that Auth0 is not really usable within the free tier (e.g. missing custom domains). As such, we decided to implement the user models in our database by using the provided adapters in `next-auth`. As an optional feature, we might also add Google and other social auth providers.                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                       |
| 6   | 2022-04-19 | Use [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry) for our containers instead of the (recommended) [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry). The decision was made due to the higher costs for the artifact registry and no significant benefits. Since we experimented with both registries, we know that we can easily switch registries should the Container Registry become unsupported. |                                                                                                                                                       |
