| 17  | 2022-07-05 | We decided to use the MIT license for our project, since it is open source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                       |
| 16  | 2022-06-12 | We decided to use https://sendgrid.com/ to send emails, since Mailjet turned out to be annoying to use and it also felt sketch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                       |
| 15  | 2022-06-07 | We decided to use https://www.mailjet.com/ to send emails. They have a free tier that should fit our purpose perfectly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                       |

| 8   | 2022-04-25 | mui.com has also a pricing list now. but we will try to use the free tier as it currently looks like it has all the features we need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                       |
| 7   | 2022-04-19 | Do not use Auth0: After some research, we found that Auth0 is not really usable within the free tier (e.g. missing custom domains). As such, we decided to implement the user models in our database by using the provided adapters in `next-auth`. As an optional feature, we might also add Google and other social auth providers.                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                       |
| 6   | 2022-04-19 | Use [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry) for our containers instead of the (recommended) [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry). The decision was made due to the higher costs for the artifact registry and no significant benefits. Since we experimented with both registries, we know that we can easily switch registries should the Container Registry become unsupported. |                                                                                                                                                       |
