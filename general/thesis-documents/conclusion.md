## General

Being able to do a project from start to finish and take on the roles from product owner to developer was an interesting
experience. It was nice to use all the software engineering principles in a project, as normally as a developer you are only involved
in the programming part. Doing a project the right way from start to finish was a refreshing experience,
but we also realized once more that it needs a lot of effort (and money üòá) and can not easily be translated to a real life 
project.

We are proud that we could realize all our goals and also implement several optional features. We could improve our software skills
a lot and had an in-depth look at some new frameworks and infrastructure. We are also happy that our initial time and milestone
planning was spot on! üí™

### The good,
- NestJS is awesome! üöÄ
- Doing React the right way is nice. 
- Google Cloud offerings are pretty cool.
- Team üòç

### the bad
- Implementing Offline Functionality in Browsers
- Implementing Authentication on your own
- Using mural for the wireframes

### ...and the ugly
- Next.js üëø
- ol-ext

Since I've always wanted to create an app for documenting my tours, it was very nice to actually *have* to work on this
otherwise hobby project. After 2 years of studying various aspects in isolation, it was exciting to bring all these
pieces together and create a software from scratch. I've learned a lot in terms of translating architecture designs into
both infrastructure and code, with all its pitfalls and downsides. It was also interesting to see how much time you
actually invest into a software when you're doing it "the proper way" and what the outcome is - something I'll
definitely put to use when dealing with customers' often lopsided expectations of delivery versus time/money.

I'm looking forward to developing the app even further - our backlog is full and our ideas will grow!

#### Positive aspects

* **Teamwork:** We did not hit any bumps, and you could always rely on each other that the assigned
  tasks will be handled properly and in a timely fashion. I also profited from the pull reviews and code/infrastructure
  discussions during our meetings. As such, it was a blast üöÄ
* **Chosen frameworks:** Both React and nest.js were a pleasure to work with. While React was sometimes a bit tedious
  because of how many ways you can actually solve things, nest.js was very straightforward due to its opinionated
  approach. I also think we profited from using Typescript in frontend and backend and I could develop a deeper
  understanding of the language. I would choose both frameworks again without hesitation.
* **Google Cloud:** Once you got the gist of it, GCP is actually very nice to use. It has services for almost everything
  and you can design really simple yet highly effective architectures at a very low cost.
* **GitHub:** Having used several source code management systems, I can now say that I really prefer GitHub: From
  creating the pipelines to using issue templates to the project boards - it is a very streamlined experience and did
  not pose any difficulties.

#### Negative Aspects

* **ol-ext:** While OpenLayers is complicated as well, it is nicely documented. ol-ext, on the other hand, is a very
  dated application with a rather ugly codebase, and you had to add several workarounds due to bad typings. At some
  point, you also had to debug the library itself to find out why it was failing. Since we're only using the clustering
  and profile feature, I think we'd be better off implementing it ourselves in a future iteration.
* **next.js:** This framework has a lot of mouthwatering marketing speeches and led us to use it in the beginning.
  However, we quickly had to realize that, although you possibly *can*, you're better off using React directly without
  the abstraction layer on top, if you're not using the main use case of SSR. It would have been nice to realize this
  before we actually used it.

#### Learnings

* React - from hooks to contexts to routing
* nest.js - an incredibly nice, Typescript-first backend framework that I'll make sure to use further
* Setting up a cloud infrastructure...
* ... with a fully integrated and automated testing pipeline
* Docker shenanigans

When I started school two and a half years ago I knew I wanted to do something fun for my master thesis which I would be happy to develop
further even after the master thesis was done. I was thinking about an application like gipfeli.io for a long time and was quite happy to have
found a team member who had almost the same idea for an app and with whom I share the same passion for hiking and being in nature. Working together was a lot 
of fun, and we had some great brainstorming sessions which resulted in the current state of gipfeli.io (and all the improvement
tickets still in the backlog. üòÇ).

It was my first project entirely written in typescript and even though as a seasoned .NET developer I was sceptical at
first to use typescript for a backend I was surprised how nice of an experience it was. Also working with React was rather new for me,
but I enjoyed it quite a lot. It certainly broadened my horizon, and I learned a lot of new and very interesting things. 
The chance to work on a project without any specifications regarding hosting,
setup and software was also quite refreshing and resulted in getting a deeper grasp on all the needed components like a solid architecture design,
a thought through infrastructure setup and writing well maintainable code. Especially the rough learnings we had with setting up Google Cloud or using NextJS
were the most fruitful in the end - personally as a developer and for my daily work in general. 
Seeing how well a project can run if the communication is right and all parties think in the same direction and are also eager to find the 
best possible solution was a great reminder to have an eye on these aspects when starting or resuming a project, and change them if they are not
optimal to make sure the project runs smoothly. 

What was very interesting from a project manager perspective was once again how much time and money you have to invest to get a decent infrastructure setup and great and
easily maintainable code. In a lot of projects I've worked on either a decent infrastructure setup was skipped or the code was written without
quality and maintainability in mind because the project was offered for a price that was too low for the expectations of the customer. It was certainly a good refresher which I can take
and use for future estimations and discussions with customers at work.

The whole master thesis, even though very exhausting due to the amount of hours we had to spend on it in a very short time, was a great experience, and I am very proud of the end result 
we managed to create. I'm really looking forward to keep on developing gipfeli.io. üöÄü•ê
